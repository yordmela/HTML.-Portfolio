<h1>The Best Movie According To Yordanos</h1>
<h2>My top movie of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The brief history of time</h3>
<p>A film about the life and work of the cosmologist, Stephen Hawking, who despite his near total paralysis, was one of the great minds of all time. </p>
<h3>The Pursuit of Happines</h3>
<p>This movie shows his struggle against poverty and how a person can survive extremely harsh conditions in life and still won't give up. The movie has an uplifting "go for your dreams" message, with the deepest theme as the love of a father for his son.
</p>
<h3>Dead Poet Society</h3>
<p>The most significant theme of the movie is 'carpe diem'. It is the phrase that professor Keating uses in his first lecture. This phrase means' seize the day' and it shows the unorthodox teaching approach of the professor. The movie highlights the importance that you only live once and you should live on your own terms.</p>
